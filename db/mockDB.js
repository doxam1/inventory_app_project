      "The Persistence of Memory (1931) by Salvador Dalí features melting clocks draped over trees and objects in a barren, surreal landscape. The distorted timepieces challenge the perception of time and reality, symbolizing the fluidity of memory and consciousness. Dalí’s dreamlike scene, with its eerie atmosphere, captures the surrealist exploration of the unconscious mind and the malleability of time, making it one of his most iconic works.",
